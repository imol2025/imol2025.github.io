      <!-- “Why IMOL 2025?” Heading + Paragraph -->
      <h2 class="page-title">The Aims of the Workshop</h2>
      <p>
        IMOL2025 will bring together researchers from AI, machine learning, robotics, cognitive science, psychology, biology, and related disciplines to share and discuss the latest advancements in intrinsically motivated and open-ended learning. The workshop will showcase cross-disciplinary research aimed at understanding and building adaptive systems capable of operating in open-ended, unpredictable environments. It will focus on mechanisms inspired by intrinsic motivation—those that enable humans and animals to explore, learn, and develop autonomously through self-generated goals and internal drives—as well as theoretical foundations, algorithmic innovations, cognitive and biological insights, and real-world applications of open-ended learning.
