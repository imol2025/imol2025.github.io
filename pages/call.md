### Registration and Submission

There is **no registration fee**, but registration is **compulsory** for participation. Registration will be based on accepted submissions. There are two ways to register:

1. **Submit an extended abstract** (up to 2 pages, _excluding references_) describing research relevant to the workshop themes. Both published and unpublished work are welcome.  
   - Accepted abstracts will be presented as posters.  
   - A select number will be invited for plenaries in the main track.

2. **Submit a brief motivation letter** if you do _not_ plan to present work but would like to attend and participate in discussions.

Please choose only one of the above submission options.  
All accepted submissions (poster abstracts or motivation letters) will count as valid registrations for IMOL 2025.

Submissions must be made via the OpenReview platform at the following link:
